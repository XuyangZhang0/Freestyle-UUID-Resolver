# Icon Placeholders

This directory contains the extension icons in different sizes required by Chrome extensions.

For a production extension, you would replace these placeholder files with actual icon images:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar)
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a consistent design across all sizes
- Ensure good contrast and visibility
- Follow Chrome extension icon design principles
- Consider both light and dark themes
- Make sure icons are recognizable at small sizes

## Suggested Icon Concept

For the UUID Resolver extension, consider an icon that represents:
- UUID/identifier concept (perhaps stylized blocks or segments)
- Resolution/transformation (arrow or connection elements)
- Workspace ONE UEM branding compatibility (if applicable)

The icon could be a minimalist design showing segmented blocks (representing UUID parts) with an arrow pointing to text or a resolved symbol.
